# Shattered Ascension Rulebook (Twilight Imperium 3)
A complete rulebook for the Shattered Ascension variant of the Twilight Imperium 3 board game.
Contains all the rules, no need for any of the original Twilight Imperium 3 rulebooks.

The rulebook itself is written in markdown.
I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to edit it, and the [MarkdownPreview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownPreview) package to render it to html (using the integrated markdown parser, not the github one). To render it in Sublime:
- Open the markdown file
- ctrl-shift-P to open the palette
- use the "Markdown Preview: Save to HTML" to produce the .html file, or "Markdown Preview: Preview in Browser" to just have a look

The rulebook is also available on the [Assets](https://www.astralvault.net/games/SA/downloads/) page of the Shattered Ascension website.
